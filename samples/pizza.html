    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons lukewarm water (105-115Â°)</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Stir water, yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl; let stand until the yeast has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Stir in whole-wheat flour, bread flour (or all-purpose flour) and cornmeal until the dough begins to come together.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, mix the dough in a food processor. Process until it forms a ball, then process for 1 minute to knead.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you're ready to make your pizza, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust the top with flour; dimple with your fingertips to shape into a thick, flattened circle--don't worry if it's not perfectly symmetrical. Then use a rolling pin to roll into a circle about 14 inches in diameter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Slide the crust onto the grill rack; close the lid. Cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.</p></li>

    </ul>
